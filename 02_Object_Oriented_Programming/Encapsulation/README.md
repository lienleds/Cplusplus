# Encapsulation in C++

Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class), restricting direct access to some components.

## Example
```cpp
class BankAccount {
private:
	double balance;
public:
	void deposit(double amount) { balance += amount; }
	double getBalance() const { return balance; }
};
```

## Benefits
- Protects data from unintended modification
- Improves code maintainability
- Enables abstraction

## Best Practices
- Keep data members private
- Provide public methods for access and modification
- Validate input in setter methods

## Step-by-Step Guide to Understanding Encapsulation

1. **Understand the Concept:**
   - Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class.
   - It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, ensuring controlled interaction through public methods.

2. **Learn About Access Specifiers:**
   - Use access specifiers (`private`, `protected`, `public`) to control the visibility of class members.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     class Example {
     private:
         int data; // Private member
     public:
         void setData(int value) { data = value; } // Public method
         int getData() const { return data; } // Public method
     };
     ```

3. **Understand the Role of Private Members:**
   - Private members are not accessible directly from outside the class.
   - They can only be accessed or modified through public methods.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     class BankAccount {
     private:
         double balance;
     public:
         void deposit(double amount) { balance += amount; }
         double getBalance() const { return balance; }
     };
     BankAccount account;
     account.deposit(1000); // Valid
     // account.balance = 1000; // Invalid, balance is private
     ```

4. **Use Public Methods for Controlled Access:**
   - Public methods act as an interface to interact with private data.
   - They can include validation logic to ensure data integrity.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     class Temperature {
     private:
         double celsius;
     public:
         void setCelsius(double temp) {
             if (temp >= -273.15) { // Validate input
                 celsius = temp;
             }
         }
         double getCelsius() const { return celsius; }
     };
     ```

5. **Understand the Benefits of Encapsulation:**
   - **Data Protection:** Prevents unintended modification of data.
   - **Abstraction:** Hides implementation details from the user.
   - **Maintainability:** Makes the code easier to maintain and debug.

6. **Practice Encapsulation:**
   - Create classes with private data members and public methods.
   - Experiment with different access specifiers to understand their impact.
   - Add validation logic in setter methods to enforce data integrity.

7. **Follow Best Practices:**
   - Always keep data members private.
   - Provide public getter and setter methods for controlled access.
   - Use meaningful names for methods to clearly indicate their purpose.

By following these steps, you can effectively understand and implement encapsulation in your C++ programs.
