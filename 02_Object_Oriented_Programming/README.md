# 02. Object-Oriented Programming

This folder covers object-oriented programming concepts in C++, including:

- **Classes and Objects:** Fundamental building blocks of OOP, representing real-world entities.
- **Inheritance:** Mechanism for reusing and extending existing code by creating derived classes.
- **Polymorphism:** Ability to use a single interface to represent different types, enabling dynamic behavior.
- **Encapsulation:** Bundling data and methods within a class to protect and control access to data.
- **Abstraction:** Hiding implementation details and exposing only the essential features.
- **Static Members:** Class-level members shared among all instances, useful for shared data and utility functions.

Each subfolder contains detailed explanations, examples, and best practices for these concepts.
