# Access Specifiers in C++

Access specifiers control the visibility of class members.

## Types of Access Specifiers

- **public**: Members are accessible from outside the class.
- **private**: Members are accessible only within the class.
- **protected**: Members are accessible in derived classes.

## Example

```cpp
class Account {
private:
	double balance;
public:
	void deposit(double amount) {
		balance += amount;
	}
	double getBalance() const {
		return balance;
	}
};
```

## Best Practices
- Keep data members private.
- Provide public methods for access and modification.
- Use protected for inheritance.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Understanding Access Specifiers

1. **Understand the Purpose:**
   - Access specifiers define the visibility and accessibility of class members (variables and methods).
   - They ensure encapsulation by restricting direct access to class members.

2. **Learn the Types of Access Specifiers:**
   - **Public:** Members are accessible from anywhere in the program.
   - **Private:** Members are accessible only within the class.
   - **Protected:** Members are accessible within the class and its derived classes.

3. **Explore Public Members:**
   - Public members can be accessed directly using an object of the class.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     class Account {
     public:
         double balance;
     };
     Account acc;
     acc.balance = 1000; // Accessible directly
     ```

4. **Understand Private Members:**
   - Private members cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.
   - Use public methods to access or modify private members.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     class Account {
     private:
         double balance;
     public:
         void deposit(double amount) {
             balance += amount;
         }
         double getBalance() const {
             return balance;
         }
     };
     Account acc;
     acc.deposit(1000); // Access through public method
     ```

5. **Learn About Protected Members:**
   - Protected members are like private members but can also be accessed in derived classes.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     class Base {
     protected:
         int value;
     };
     class Derived : public Base {
     public:
         void setValue(int val) {
             value = val; // Accessible in derived class
         }
     };
     ```

6. **Understand the Benefits of Encapsulation:**
   - Protects the integrity of data by preventing unauthorized access.
   - Simplifies debugging and maintenance by controlling how data is accessed and modified.

7. **Practice:**
   - Create classes with different access specifiers.
   - Experiment with accessing members from outside the class and within derived classes.
   - Observe how access specifiers enforce encapsulation.

8. **Follow Best Practices:**
   - Keep data members private to ensure encapsulation.
   - Use public methods to provide controlled access to private members.
   - Use protected members only when inheritance is required.
