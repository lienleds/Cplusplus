# Abstraction in C++

Abstraction hides complex implementation details and exposes only the necessary features of an object.

## Example: Abstract Class
```cpp
class Shape {
public:
	virtual void draw() = 0; // Pure virtual function
};
class Circle : public Shape {
public:
	void draw() override { std::cout << "Drawing Circle"; }
};
```

## Benefits
- Simplifies code usage
- Reduces complexity
- Promotes modularity

## Best Practices
- Use abstract classes for common interfaces
- Implement pure virtual functions in derived classes
- Avoid exposing unnecessary details

## Step-by-Step Guide to Understanding Abstraction

1. **Understand the Concept:**
   - Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details of an object and exposing only the essential features.
   - It focuses on "what" an object does rather than "how" it does it.

2. **Learn About Abstract Classes:**
   - Abstract classes are classes that cannot be instantiated directly.
   - They contain at least one pure virtual function, which must be implemented by derived classes.

3. **Explore Pure Virtual Functions:**
   - A pure virtual function is declared by assigning `= 0` to a virtual function.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     virtual void draw() = 0;
     ```

4. **Understand Derived Classes:**
   - Derived classes inherit from abstract classes and provide implementations for pure virtual functions.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     class Circle : public Shape {
     public:
         void draw() override { std::cout << "Drawing Circle"; }
     };
     ```

5. **See Abstraction in Action:**
   - Use pointers or references to the abstract class to work with derived class objects.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     Shape* shape = new Circle();
     shape->draw(); // Outputs: Drawing Circle
     delete shape;
     ```

6. **Understand the Benefits:**
   - Simplifies code usage by focusing on high-level operations.
   - Reduces complexity by hiding implementation details.
   - Promotes modularity and reusability.

7. **Practice:**
   - Create your own abstract classes and derived classes.
   - Experiment with different implementations to understand how abstraction works in real-world scenarios.
