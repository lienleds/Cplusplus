# Thread Detach in C++

## What is `std::thread::detach`?

`std::thread::detach` is a method in the C++ Standard Library that allows a thread to run independently from the thread that created it. Once a thread is detached, it becomes a daemon thread, meaning it will continue to execute even if the main thread finishes.

## Why Use `detach`?

- **Independent Execution:** Allows a thread to run independently without requiring the main thread to wait for its completion.
- **Fire-and-Forget Threads:** Useful for tasks that do not need synchronization with the main thread.

## Syntax

```cpp
void detach();
```

## Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <chrono>

void threadFunction() {
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(2));
    std::cout << "Thread has finished execution." << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    std::thread t(threadFunction);

    // Detach the thread
    t.detach();

    std::cout << "Main thread is continuing..." << std::endl;
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(3));

    return 0;
}
```

### Output
```
Main thread is continuing...
Thread has finished execution.
```

## Key Points

1. **Non-Blocking Call:** `detach` allows the main thread to continue execution without waiting for the detached thread.
2. **Daemon Threads:** Detached threads run independently and are not joined with the main thread.
3. **Responsibility:** Once detached, the thread's resources are automatically cleaned up when it finishes execution.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Accessing Shared Data:** Detached threads can lead to race conditions if they access shared data without proper synchronization.
- **Thread Lifetime:** Ensure the detached thread does not access resources that may be destroyed before it finishes execution.
- **No Join After Detach:** A detached thread cannot be joined later.

## Best Practices

- Use `detach` only when the thread's lifetime is well-managed and does not depend on the main thread.
- Avoid accessing shared resources without proper synchronization mechanisms like mutexes.
- Prefer `std::jthread` (C++20) or thread pools for better thread lifecycle management.
