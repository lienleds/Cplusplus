# Debugging Techniques

Debugging is the process of identifying and resolving issues in a program. Effective debugging techniques are essential for developing reliable and maintainable software.

## Common Debugging Techniques

### 1. Print Statements
- **Description:** Insert `std::cout` statements to display variable values and program flow.
- **Advantages:**
  - Simple and quick.
  - No additional tools required.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Tedious for large programs.
  - Requires manual removal after debugging.

### Example
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int x = 10;
    std::cout << "Value of x: " << x << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```

### 2. Debuggers
- **Description:** Use tools like GDB (GNU Debugger) to step through code, set breakpoints, and inspect variables.
- **Advantages:**
  - Powerful and versatile.
  - Non-intrusive (no code modification).
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Requires learning the debugger tool.

### Example: Using GDB
```bash
# Compile with debugging symbols
g++ -g main.cpp -o main

# Run GDB
gdb ./main

# Common GDB commands:
# - break <line_number>: Set a breakpoint.
# - run: Start the program.
# - next: Execute the next line.
# - print <variable>: Display variable value.
```

### 3. Logging
- **Description:** Use logging libraries (e.g., `spdlog`, `Boost.Log`) to record program events.
- **Advantages:**
  - Persistent record of program execution.
  - Configurable log levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, ERROR).
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Requires integration of a logging library.

### Example: Using `spdlog`
```cpp
#include <spdlog/spdlog.h>

int main() {
    spdlog::info("Program started");
    int x = 10;
    spdlog::debug("Value of x: {}", x);
    return 0;
}
```

### 4. Unit Tests
- **Description:** Write tests to verify the correctness of individual components.
- **Advantages:**
  - Detects bugs early.
  - Facilitates regression testing.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Time-consuming to write tests.

### Example: Using Google Test
```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

TEST(AdditionTest, HandlesPositiveNumbers) {
    EXPECT_EQ(add(2, 3), 5);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
    return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

### 5. Static Analysis Tools
- **Description:** Analyze code for potential issues without executing it.
- **Examples:**
  - `clang-tidy`
  - `cppcheck`
- **Advantages:**
  - Detects subtle bugs and code smells.
  - Enforces coding standards.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - May produce false positives.

### Example: Using `cppcheck`
```bash
cppcheck --enable=all main.cpp
```

## Analysis
- **Advantages of Debugging Techniques:**
  - Improve code reliability and maintainability.
  - Facilitate understanding of program behavior.
- **Challenges:**
  - Debugging complex systems can be time-consuming.
  - Requires familiarity with debugging tools and techniques.

---

## Best Practices
- Use a combination of debugging techniques for maximum effectiveness.
- Write unit tests to catch bugs early.
- Use logging for persistent records of program execution.
- Regularly run static analysis tools to maintain code quality.

---

## Summary
Debugging is an essential skill for software development. By mastering various debugging techniques and tools, developers can efficiently identify and resolve issues, leading to more reliable and maintainable code.
