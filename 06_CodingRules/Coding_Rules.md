# C++ Coding Rules and Best Practices

This document outlines essential coding rules and best practices for writing maintainable, readable, and robust C++ code.

## 1. Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
- Follow a consistent style (camelCase, PascalCase, snake_case).
- Avoid abbreviations unless widely accepted.

## 2. Indentation and Formatting
- Use consistent indentation (spaces or tabs).
- Align code for readability.
- Place opening braces `{}` on the same line as the statement.

## 3. Control Structures
- Always use braces `{}` for all control blocks, even single statements.
- Avoid deeply nested code.

## 4. Constants and Magic Numbers
- Avoid magic numbers; use named constants or enums.
- Prefer `const` and `constexpr` for immutable values.

## 5. Comments and Documentation
- Comment complex logic and important decisions.
- Use Doxygen-style comments for public APIs and classes.
- Avoid redundant comments.

## 6. Functions and Methods
- Keep functions short and focused on a single task.
- Limit function length and complexity.
- Use meaningful parameter names.
- Document parameters and return values.

## 7. Variables
- Minimize the use of global variables.
- Prefer local scope for variables.
- Initialize variables before use.

## 8. Memory Management
- Use smart pointers (`std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`) for dynamic memory.
- Avoid manual `new`/`delete` unless necessary.
- Use RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) for resource management.

## 9. Exception Handling
- Handle exceptions properly; avoid empty catch blocks.
- Use exceptions for error handling, not for control flow.

## 10. STL and Modern C++
- Prefer STL containers and algorithms over manual implementations.
- Use range-based for loops and auto keyword where appropriate.
- Avoid using `using namespace std;` in headers.

## 11. Testing and Quality
- Write unit tests for critical code.
- Use assertions to catch errors early.
- Review and refactor code regularly.

## 12. Project-Specific Guidelines
- Follow any additional style guides or conventions required by your project or team.
