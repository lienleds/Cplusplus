# PascalCase in C++

`PascalCase` is a naming convention in which the first letter of each word is capitalized. This convention is commonly used in C++ for naming classes, namespaces, and certain types of constants.

---

## Why Use PascalCase?
- **Readability:** Makes class and namespace names easily distinguishable.
- **Consistency:** Ensures uniformity across the codebase.
- **Industry Standard:** Widely adopted for class and namespace naming in C++.

## Examples of PascalCase

### Classes
```cpp
class BankAccount {
private:
    float accountBalance;

public:
    void deposit(float amount) {
        accountBalance += amount;
    }

    float getBalance() {
        return accountBalance;
    }
};
```

### Namespaces
```cpp
namespace FinancialTools {
    void calculateInterest(float principal, float rate) {
        // Function logic
    }
}
```

### Constants (Optional)
While not universally adopted, PascalCase is sometimes used for constants.
```cpp
const int MaxConnections = 100;
const float PiValue = 3.14159;
```

---

## Best Practices
- **Consistency:** Always use PascalCase for class and namespace names unless the project specifies a different convention.
- **Avoid Abbreviations:** Use descriptive names to improve code clarity.
- **Follow Project Guidelines:** Adhere to the naming conventions specified in the project's coding standards.

## Comparison with Other Naming Conventions

| Convention      | Example           | Common Usage                  |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| `camelCase`     | `userAge`         | Variables, functions          |
| `PascalCase`    | `BankAccount`     | Class names, namespaces       |
| `snake_case`    | `user_age`        | Constants, macros (sometimes) |

---

## Summary
Using `PascalCase` in C++ helps maintain a clean and consistent codebase. By following this convention, developers can improve the readability and maintainability of their code, especially for class and namespace names.
