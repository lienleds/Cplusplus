# snake_case in C++

`snake_case` is a naming convention in which words are separated by underscores, and all letters are typically lowercase. This convention is commonly used in C++ for naming constants, macros, and sometimes variables.

---

## Why Use snake_case?
- **Readability:** Improves the readability of long names by clearly separating words.
- **Consistency:** Ensures uniformity across the codebase.
- **Industry Standard:** Often used for constants and macros in C++.

---

## Examples of snake_case

### Constants
```cpp
const int max_connections = 100;
const float pi_value = 3.14159;
```

### Macros
```cpp
#define BUFFER_SIZE 1024
#define MAX_USERS 50
```

### Variables (Optional)
While not as common, snake_case can also be used for variables in certain coding styles.
```cpp
int user_age = 25;
float account_balance = 1000.50;
```

## Best Practices
- **Consistency:** Always use snake_case for constants and macros unless the project specifies a different convention.
- **Avoid Overuse:** Reserve snake_case for specific use cases like constants and macros.
- **Follow Project Guidelines:** Adhere to the naming conventions specified in the project's coding standards.

## Comparison with Other Naming Conventions

| Convention      | Example           | Common Usage                  |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| `camelCase`     | `userAge`         | Variables, functions          |
| `PascalCase`    | `BankAccount`     | Class names, namespaces       |
| `snake_case`    | `user_age`        | Constants, macros             |

---

## Summary
Using `snake_case` in C++ helps maintain a clean and consistent codebase, especially for constants and macros. By following this convention, developers can improve the readability and maintainability of their code.
